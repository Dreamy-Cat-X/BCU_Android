# BCU_Android
Fork of BCU Android. Meant primarily to support content from the [BCU Sun Fork](https://github.com/Blacksun420/BCU-java-PC), although it serves as an updated version of its apparently defunct upstream version too.

There's a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CcVwdRU6th) for the fork o algo
